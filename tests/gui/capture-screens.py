"""Render every wizard page to PNG, plus an animated walkthrough, for
docs/gui-walkthrough.md and the README.

Runs headless under Xvfb with no desktop, no GPU and no real disks: the app's
pages are built against fixtures, driven through the real InstallerWindow, and
grabbed from the X server.

Nothing here touches a disk. core.host_run — the single seam every hardware
query goes through — is replaced with canned lsblk output, so `candidate_disks`
sees a plausible machine that does not exist.

# LAUNCHES A REAL INSTALL — there is no confirmation between the two. A capture
# script that drove pages the obvious way would try to partition the runner's
# disk.
#
# This used to be `InstallerWindow.start_install = lambda self, page: None`,
# applied before any page was shown. That protected THIS script and nothing
# else: a monkeypatch in one test file is invisible to anything driving the
# real binary, which is exactly what the live-ISO walkthrough harness in
# tuna-os/tunaOS does over a QEMU keyboard with no ability to patch anything.
#
# The interlock now lives in the app (core.DRY_RUN, honoured as the first
