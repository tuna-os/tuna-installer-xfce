"""Emit `walkthrough-<flavor>.json` — the file tunaOS's installer parity
matrix consumes.

WHY THIS EXISTS. tunaOS defines the screen contract once, in
`tests/installer-screens.yaml`, and `scripts/installer-walkthrough.py` fills
the parity matrix in `docs/INSTALLER-FRONTENDS.md` from a
`walkthrough-<flavor>.json` per frontend. That harness boots a VM and OCRs
QEMU screendumps, so it needs a virgl-capable host — which is why the matrix
has read `_GPU_` / `_pending_` for niri and xfce since it was written, and why
two crash-on-launch bugs and a 93%-white screen survived in frontends nobody
had ever measured.

This module emits the SAME file from the GPU-less capture that already runs on
a stock CI runner. No new contract, no new mechanism: the screenshots we
already take are re-reported in the shape the matrix already reads.

HOW IT DIFFERS FROM THE VM HARNESS, stated so nobody reads more into the
numbers than is there:

  * Text comes from the WIDGET TREE, not OCR. `"ocr": false` and
    `"text_source": "widget-tree"` say so. This is strictly stronger evidence
    for keyword matching (no recognition error) and strictly weaker evidence
    of "a user could read it" (a string set on an invisible or clipped widget
    still counts). The pixel audit that gates this capture is what covers the
    latter, and its per-page verdict is reported as `rendered`.
  * `activation_key` is null. Pages are driven programmatically, so this says
    NOTHING about whether keyboard navigation works — the defect the VM
    harness found on KDE (enter does nothing) is invisible here and must stay
    the VM run's job.
  * `frames` are wizard pages, one per page, not timed samples of a live VM.

Everything else — the metrics, the thresholds, and the rule about which
screens may be credited — is deliberately identical to
`scripts/installer-walkthrough.py` so the two sources are comparable.
