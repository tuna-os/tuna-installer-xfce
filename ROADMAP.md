# TunaOS XFCE Installer — Roadmap

**Last updated**: 2026-08-24 | **Maintainer**: tuna-os (hanthor)

## Mission

Ship the XFCE desktop's install experience: a GTK3 frontend that drives the
fisherman bootc backend — welcome, image selection, disk selection, filesystem
and encryption, account, confirmation, install progress, completion — so a
first-time XFCE user gets a native install from first boot to desktop.

---

## Current Status

- **App**: GTK3 frontend for fisherman; CI-rendered walkthrough in
  docs/gui-walkthrough.md.
- **Distribution**: image-baked flatpak — no standalone GitHub Releases (by
  design, not yet documented as policy).
- **Parity**: covered by `installer-smoke.yml` + `docs/INSTALLER-FRONTENDS.md`
  checks (readiness stamp, non-blank, advances, per-screen OCR).
- **Health**: active (pushed 08-24); 40 unit tests exist but nothing runs them
  in CI (#23).
