"""Readiness stamp: a compositor-independent record that a window really mapped.

WHY THIS EXISTS

tunaOS's `installer-smoke.yml` proves the frontend is up with `flatpak ps`,
which answers "is the process alive". That is not the same question as "did the
user get a window", and the two have already diverged in production: the COSMIC
leg had the installer process running with no window ever appearing on screen,
and the check stayed green. The only thing that noticed was a human looking at
a screenshot.

Inferring it from pixels is the other half of the same problem — it needs a
compositor that renders, and four of the five desktops need a DRM render node
that GitHub-hosted runners do not have. So the frontend says so itself, in a
file, which any runner can read over SSH with no GPU and no OCR.

WHAT IT RECORDS

The window class and the wizard page that was showing when it mapped. XFCE only
ever maps InstallerWindow, so the class matters less here than it does in
bootc-installer (whose do_activate can present a not-enough-RAM window that
`flatpak ps` reports as a healthy install) — but the field is part of the
contract and stays uniform across the frontends that implement it.

The page is the useful half here: it distinguishes "a window mapped" from "the
wizard reached its first page", which is the thing a smoke test actually wants
to know.

DUPLICATION, DELIBERATELY FLAGGED

This file is a near-copy of bootc_installer/readiness.py, because the five
frontends share no code at all — they are five independent implementations in
five languages, and this is the fifth thing to be reimplemented five times
(after the offline-store probe, the privilege escalation, the product-name
resolution and the encryption table). The contract is small enough that copying
it is the right call today; docs/INSTALLER-FRONTENDS.md in tunaOS is where the
canonical field list lives, and it is what a sixth frontend should be written
against.
